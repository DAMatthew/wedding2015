                        dose of GChat led to occassional greetings in the hall. 
                        They drove together during a weekend ski trip with some of their colleagues: 
                        a ten hour winding trip through the mountains. 
                        They were either going to kill each other,
                        or fall for each other. Fortunately the latter occurred.

                                not amenable to an outdoor ceremony, then the event will be moved inside the mansion.
