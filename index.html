                     <p>
                        We met at work in the fall of 2013. We had both joined Appian that summer 
                        and we were taking our first professional steps in the software industry. That winter saw us
                        both working on demanding projects that required late hours. Our 
                        late night coding sessions together plus a healthy dose of Google GChat led to more 
                        frequent greetings in the hall. 
                     </p>
                     <p> About this time some colleagues of ours arranged a weekend ski trip in West 
                        Virginia and we decided to drive the ten hour winding trip through the mountains with each other.               
                        At this point we were probably either going to kill each other or fall in love. Fortunately the 
                        latter occurred and as soon as we got back to Virginia we planned our first real date.
                     </p>
                     <p>  We had dinner and followed this with a middle school-esque hang out at the Tysons Corner mall. 
                        We walked around and talked for nearly two hours and then relocated to a nearby bar after the mall closed, 
                        because neither of us wanted the night to end. About a week later we made it official and not long 
                        after that we realized that nothing could be better than spending the rest of our lives together.

                              High school brought countless sleepovers and two-person dance parties.

                              at Goodwill and watching chick flicks instead of doing their engineering homework.

                        <p>The ceremony will start at 11am on Sunday, April 26th, 2015. It is 
                           scheduled to take place outside, in the lovely pavilion behind the Ceresville 
                           Mansion. If the weather is not amenable to an outdoor ceremony, then the event 
                           will be moved to inside the mansion. The average temperature for late April is 
                           around 60° and the dress code is semi-formal so please keep this in mind when 
                           planning your attire. There is ample parking on-site located very close to the 
                           ceremony location. A cocktail hour in the front parlor of the mansion will immediately 
                           follow the ceremony.
